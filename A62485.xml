            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my la≈øt I gave you an account of our affaires till ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterday morning, and then I left <hi>Goring</hi> with his whole Army at Lamport; ≈øince then be plea≈øed to take notice of a ≈øhort relation of our actions. Ye≈øterday wee advanced to Sutton, drawing out that part of our Army, which we had, into Sutton fields, the re≈øt being 4500 at the lea≈øt, under the command of Major-Generall <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey,</hi> were on the other ≈øide of the river, and tho≈øe eight Regiments of Foot which wee had at Naesby field, were al≈øo quartered at Martoke; <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> advanced with his Hor≈øe and Dragoons, having the Foot to back him to North-Carreg, being ordered to ≈øtraiten the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies quarters, and to hinder them from any plundring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øes. It ≈øeems 1500 of them being upon a de≈øigne out, and having no intelligence of his being in motion, were ≈øurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in a carele≈ø≈øe po≈øture; Major-Generall <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> fell on them, took (as I take it) nine Colours, 200 pri≈øoners, and 250 Hor≈øe, ≈ølew about 30. Wee (in the meane time) were drawne up within a mile of Lamport, with tho≈øe Hor≈øe the Generall had with him, not knowing of his engagement, and there being three rivers betweene him and us, and the way without 12 miles march. The la≈øt night we quartered at Sutton, and this morning by three a clock drew out into Sutton-fields, having with us but ≈øeven Regiments of hor≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Generals, formerly called Lievtenant-Generall <hi>Cromwells, Whaley's, Vermudens, Graves, Rich, Fleetwood, Butlers,</hi> which were not in all 2800 Hor≈øe; of Foot, we had all but the Musketiers of three Regiments, having ≈øent for

               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->them the la≈øt night from Martoke. Early this morning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy appeared in the field, and about 7. of the clock they made them≈øelves Ma≈øters of a pa≈ø≈øe, which lay in the mid≈øt between our Body and theirs, had lined the hedges between us and them with at lea≈øt 2000 Musketiers, ≈øo that the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage to them was extraordinary dangerous, being ≈øo ≈øtraight that foure hor≈øes could not pa≈ø≈øe a bre≈øt, and that up to the belly in water. They lying ≈øo prepared, both in Flanks and Front to receive us; in this po≈øture they ≈øtood till nigh 11 of the clock, having in the interim ≈øent away mo≈øt of their Traine and Baggage, led Hor≈øes, and other Lumber, to Bridgewater, being re≈øolved to make good their Retreat thither, which they conceived they could, having ≈øuch an advantagious pa≈ø≈øe thither; we under≈øtanding their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ≈øome Spies, and other Countrey-men, re≈øolved to charge them, and accordingly drew downe a commanded partie of Musketiers to beat them from the hedges, which was done with a gallant re≈øolution; advancing the ≈øame time with two Regiments of Hor≈øe into the Lane, all that we could draw up in Front was but a ≈øingle Troop, and that commanded by Major <hi>Bethell,</hi> the Enemy ≈øtanding ready with three Bodies of Hor≈øe, of about a thou≈øand to charge him. He with a ≈øingle Troop charged, and routed two of their Divi≈øions of about 400, received the charge of the third Divi≈øion both in Front and Flank, was ≈øomewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-borne at la≈øt, and enforced to retire to the Generals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, which was about an hundred yards behind him: C. <hi>Desborow</hi> with the Generalls Troope ≈øheltred him by his Flank to rally, and charged up him≈øelfe with about 200 Hor≈øe of the Generals Regiment, di≈øper≈øt the Enemy, and ≈øet them all a running, gained freedome by it for all our Hor≈øe and Foot to draw into Bodies, ≈øent the Enemy run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not being able to endure. In the charge the Generall,
<pb facs="tcp:36747:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->Lievtenant-Generall, and ≈øome other Officers upon the hill beholding the gallant charge, commended it for the mo≈øt excellent peece of ≈øervice that ever was in England, we had them in chace almo≈øt to Bridgewater, having put them to the cleere≈øt Rout that ever an Enemy was put to: what the number of the ≈ølaine be I cannot tell you, being ≈øcarce come from the chace: The pri≈øoners come in already are 900, and I beleeve there will come in as many as wil make 2000. 1200 Hor≈øe taken at lea≈øt: For Colours I am uncertaine, I dare ≈øay at lea≈øt 40, the Armes at lea≈øt 4000, two peeces of Ordnance I ≈øaw, and divers carriages of Ammunition, and to make it a compleat victorie, wee pur≈øued the Enemy thorow Lamport, having gained the Garri≈øon, and then they fired the Towne ju≈øt at the bridge to hinder the chace, yet we followed the victorie thorow the fire. The ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of this victorie mu≈øt needs be a≈øcribed next unto God, to the good conduct of the Generall and <hi>Cromwell, Cromwell</hi> following the chace thorow Lamport, where hee him≈øelfe went thorow the fire flaming on both ≈øides of him. The Enemy crie out they are utterly undone, and that the King mu≈øt now go for Ireland. Sir, this victorie was the more opportune, that had they ≈øtaid but three dayes longer, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> would have had a re-inforcement of 6000 Hor≈øe and Foot from <hi>Greenvill</hi> and the King, they being tran≈øporting their Forces as fa≈øt as can be to Minehead, Watchead, and Uphill, there being 1500 that landed ad Uphill come to Bridgewater ye≈øterday.

            <p>This day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our drawing into the field within two miles of Lamport, a pretty ≈øtrong Garri≈øon of the enemies. Our Army was ranged into a Battalia, and the Forlorn Hopes on each wing being drawne out and marched, the whole Army pre≈øently advanced, the enemy having ≈øecured a pa≈ø≈øage, which was the onely way for us to make through to fall on them; where we could not march above foure hor≈øe a bre≈øt, in which place the enemy did front, and flank us al≈øo on both ≈øides: when our Forlorns marched nigh them, (the Hill they ≈øtood on, they divided them≈øelves on, in ≈øeverall divi≈øions and ≈øquadrons of Hor≈øe and Foot) our Foot fired in Volleyes, and our Ordnance played ≈øo quick and ≈øure, that pre≈øently the enemy were put to a rout, and were as in a maze, not knowing what way to avoid the Cannon; yet all this while maintained the pa≈ø≈øage, which was in hot di≈øpute betweene them and us; yet at la≈øt, within an houre or thereabouts, we gained it, and ≈øent Hor≈øe to ≈øecond our Foot. One Major <hi>Bethell</hi> with his Troupe went on in the fir≈øt place, and was to go up a ≈øteepe hill to charge (and but his own Troupe) by the time he came neere: the Enemy came on in a va≈øt Body of Hor≈øe again≈øt them, and laid Musketiers in a hedge, which did flank him, and ≈øomwhat front him al≈øo, yet with ≈øuch gallantry he mannaged the charge, that they put the enemy to the rout, (all in that place) but pre≈øently a great fre≈øh ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply came, that cau≈øed our fir≈øt party to retreat to the pa≈ø≈øage to our men, who played on the enemy, and cau≈øed them to retreat, and then our Hor≈øe and Foot marched on furiou≈øly,
<pb facs="tcp:36747:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 64 -->and at the ≈øecond charge beat the enemy out of the field, put them to a rout, we killed on the ≈øeverall hils we ≈øtood on, and valleyes we fought in, not above 20. but in the pur≈øuit very many. There are already brought in nigh 1000. pri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, two Carriages of Ammunition, and two ≈ømall pieces, which were all they had in the field. They for≈øooke their Garri≈øon of Lamporne, and are gone towards Bridgewater. Ye≈øterday Major-Generall <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey</hi> went with about 7000. Hor≈øe, Dragoons, and Foot, on the other ≈øide of Lamport, skirmi≈øhed with the enemy, and took about 500. hor≈øe, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈ølain, and 200. taken, whereof two Majors, 6. Captaines, and nine Colours. I am in health, and all our friends, for ought I heare; I cannot particularize yet, for our men are not all returned from the pur≈øuit. The Kings partie here is quite routed, and I hope we ≈øhall ≈øuddenly drive them from having an Army in the field, and vi≈øit their Garri≈øons. God hath wonderfully appeared with his people who fir≈øt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that ≈øcarce ever any ≈øuch Charge was ≈øeen in England heretofore.
