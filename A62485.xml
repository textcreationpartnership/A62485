            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my laſt I gave you an account of our affaires till ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday morning, and then I left <hi>Goring</hi> with his whole Army at Lamport; ſince then be pleaſed to take notice of a ſhort relation of our actions. Yeſterday wee advanced to Sutton, drawing out that part of our Army, which we had, into Sutton fields, the reſt being 4500 at the leaſt, under the command of Major-Generall <hi>Maſſey,</hi> were on the other ſide of the river, and thoſe eight Regiments of Foot which wee had at Naesby field, were alſo quartered at Martoke; <hi>Maſſey</hi> advanced with his Horſe and Dragoons, having the Foot to back him to North-Carreg, being ordered to ſtraiten the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies quarters, and to hinder them from any plundring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. It ſeems 1500 of them being upon a deſigne out, and having no intelligence of his being in motion, were ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in a careleſſe poſture; Major-Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> fell on them, took (as I take it) nine Colours, 200 priſoners, and 250 Horſe, ſlew about 30. Wee (in the meane time) were drawne up within a mile of Lamport, with thoſe Horſe the Generall had with him, not knowing of his engagement, and there being three rivers betweene him and us, and the way without 12 miles march. The laſt night we quartered at Sutton, and this morning by three a clock drew out into Sutton-fields, having with us but ſeven Regiments of horſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Generals, formerly called Lievtenant-Generall <hi>Cromwells, Whaley's, Vermudens, Graves, Rich, Fleetwood, Butlers,</hi> which were not in all 2800 Horſe; of Foot, we had all but the Musketiers of three Regiments, having ſent for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36747:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->them the laſt night from Martoke. Early this morning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy appeared in the field, and about 7. of the clock they made themſelves Maſters of a paſſe, which lay in the midſt between our Body and theirs, had lined the hedges between us and them with at leaſt 2000 Musketiers, ſo that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to them was extraordinary dangerous, being ſo ſtraight that foure horſes could not paſſe a breſt, and that up to the belly in water. They lying ſo prepared, both in Flanks and Front to receive us; in this poſture they ſtood till nigh 11 of the clock, having in the interim ſent away moſt of their Traine and Baggage, led Horſes, and other Lumber, to Bridgewater, being reſolved to make good their Retreat thither, which they conceived they could, having ſuch an advantagious paſſe thither; we underſtanding their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by ſome Spies, and other Countrey-men, reſolved to charge them, and accordingly drew downe a commanded partie of Musketiers to beat them from the hedges, which was done with a gallant reſolution; advancing the ſame time with two Regiments of Horſe into the Lane, all that we could draw up in Front was but a ſingle Troop, and that commanded by Major <hi>Bethell,</hi> the Enemy ſtanding ready with three Bodies of Horſe, of about a thouſand to charge him. He with a ſingle Troop charged, and routed two of their Diviſions of about 400, received the charge of the third Diviſion both in Front and Flank, was ſomewhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-borne at laſt, and enforced to retire to the Generals Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, which was about an hundred yards behind him: C. <hi>Desborow</hi> with the Generalls Troope ſheltred him by his Flank to rally, and charged up himſelfe with about 200 Horſe of the Generals Regiment, diſperſt the Enemy, and ſet them all a running, gained freedome by it for all our Horſe and Foot to draw into Bodies, ſent the Enemy run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not being able to endure. In the charge the Generall,
<pb facs="tcp:36747:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->Lievtenant-Generall, and ſome other Officers upon the hill beholding the gallant charge, commended it for the moſt excellent peece of ſervice that ever was in England, we had them in chace almoſt to Bridgewater, having put them to the cleereſt Rout that ever an Enemy was put to: what the number of the ſlaine be I cannot tell you, being ſcarce come from the chace: The priſoners come in already are 900, and I beleeve there will come in as many as wil make 2000. 1200 Horſe taken at leaſt: For Colours I am uncertaine, I dare ſay at leaſt 40, the Armes at leaſt 4000, two peeces of Ordnance I ſaw, and divers carriages of Ammunition, and to make it a compleat victorie, wee purſued the Enemy thorow Lamport, having gained the Garriſon, and then they fired the Towne juſt at the bridge to hinder the chace, yet we followed the victorie thorow the fire. The ſucceſſe of this victorie muſt needs be aſcribed next unto God, to the good conduct of the Generall and <hi>Cromwell, Cromwell</hi> following the chace thorow Lamport, where hee himſelfe went thorow the fire flaming on both ſides of him. The Enemy crie out they are utterly undone, and that the King muſt now go for Ireland. Sir, this victorie was the more opportune, that had they ſtaid but three dayes longer, <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> would have had a re-inforcement of 6000 Horſe and Foot from <hi>Greenvill</hi> and the King, they being tranſporting their Forces as faſt as can be to Minehead, Watchead, and Uphill, there being 1500 that landed ad Uphill come to Bridgewater yeſterday.

            <p>This day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our drawing into the field within two miles of Lamport, a pretty ſtrong Garriſon of the enemies. Our Army was ranged into a Battalia, and the Forlorn Hopes on each wing being drawne out and marched, the whole Army preſently advanced, the enemy having ſecured a paſſage, which was the onely way for us to make through to fall on them; where we could not march above foure horſe a breſt, in which place the enemy did front, and flank us alſo on both ſides: when our Forlorns marched nigh them, (the Hill they ſtood on, they divided themſelves on, in ſeverall diviſions and ſquadrons of Horſe and Foot) our Foot fired in Volleyes, and our Ordnance played ſo quick and ſure, that preſently the enemy were put to a rout, and were as in a maze, not knowing what way to avoid the Cannon; yet all this while maintained the paſſage, which was in hot diſpute betweene them and us; yet at laſt, within an houre or thereabouts, we gained it, and ſent Horſe to ſecond our Foot. One Major <hi>Bethell</hi> with his Troupe went on in the firſt place, and was to go up a ſteepe hill to charge (and but his own Troupe) by the time he came neere: the Enemy came on in a vaſt Body of Horſe againſt them, and laid Musketiers in a hedge, which did flank him, and ſomwhat front him alſo, yet with ſuch gallantry he mannaged the charge, that they put the enemy to the rout, (all in that place) but preſently a great freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply came, that cauſed our firſt party to retreat to the paſſage to our men, who played on the enemy, and cauſed them to retreat, and then our Horſe and Foot marched on furiouſly,
<pb facs="tcp:36747:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 64 -->and at the ſecond charge beat the enemy out of the field, put them to a rout, we killed on the ſeverall hils we ſtood on, and valleyes we fought in, not above 20. but in the purſuit very many. There are already brought in nigh 1000. priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, two Carriages of Ammunition, and two ſmall pieces, which were all they had in the field. They forſooke their Garriſon of Lamporne, and are gone towards Bridgewater. Yeſterday Major-Generall <hi>Maſſey</hi> went with about 7000. Horſe, Dragoons, and Foot, on the other ſide of Lamport, skirmiſhed with the enemy, and took about 500. horſe, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſlain, and 200. taken, whereof two Majors, 6. Captaines, and nine Colours. I am in health, and all our friends, for ought I heare; I cannot particularize yet, for our men are not all returned from the purſuit. The Kings partie here is quite routed, and I hope we ſhall ſuddenly drive them from having an Army in the field, and viſit their Garriſons. God hath wonderfully appeared with his people who firſt char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that ſcarce ever any ſuch Charge was ſeen in England heretofore. The Generall and honeſt <hi>Cromwell</hi> behaved themſelves moſt gallantly. I am in haſt, and reſt,</p>
